**Final Project of MO505 in KAIST**

In this course, I learned basic knowledge about FEM and even carried out an actual final project. This article is a post about the final project.

Among the issues related to mobility, I thought of a big accident in India that I heard on the news a while ago.
The Uttrakhand tunnel collapsed in November 2023.

According to a survey conducted by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, there are a total of 2,682 tunnels on domestic roads as of 2019. Among them, 1,204 tunnels exist on highways alone.

Therefore, motivation was created for the tunnel structure, and finally, I tried to conduct a comparative experiment on the waveform steel plate.

As shown below, the modeling of the circular shape and the square shape and the comparison of the results were performed.

The following are the modeling and experimental results for waveform steel plates.

In this project, waveform steel plates could not be judged to be more effective.

I thought it would be good to supplement these points.

1. Wave steel plates have a complex shape that tends to concentrate the load locally
2. Complex shapes can cause uneven elements in mesh generation
3. Load condition different from the actual pressure applied on the ground
4. Could be modeled differently
