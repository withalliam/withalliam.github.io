Sudoku is a popular logic-based puzzle game that involves filling a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids (called "regions") contains all of the digits from 1 to 9 without repetition. The puzzle starts with some cells already filled in, and the goal is to fill in the empty cells while following the rules.
