**Final Project**

The first project when I was an undergraduate, a project in the OSSL(Open Source Software Lab) course. The final project of this course was allowed for anything using open-source, and I made the wesane game a version of Handong Global University.

You can play through this link. However, the resolution doesn't seem to work well on PC. **I recommend you try it on mobile.** [GAME LINK](https://daxigua-master-seokjunkim.vercel.app/)

**What does this project do?**
<br>
This project developed the Wesane game through open source and made it a vesrion suitable for Handong Global University so that studensts can enjoy it. Using Raspberry pi and html, I created a web that explain the game briefly, and start the game. (The website is now unavailable.)

**The things I did on this project**
1. First of all, I edited the image files in a resolution that fits the game.

2. I downloaded the Wesane game code file from GitHub.

3. I registered the image for resolution on website and downloaded the compressed file.
4. I installed Node.js program, and signed up for Vercel via GitHub account.
5. By using the cmd command prompt, I obtained my game link.
6. I created the web using Raspberry pi and html, then made my own version using a free html template.

**How do I get started?**

1. When you start the game, you can see Ïò§ÏÑùÍ¥Ä with the beautiful sunset. (I took this picture üòÄ)
2. If you press or drag the screen away, the ball drops to that position.
3. Each time you press, the ball drops randomly from freshman duck to returning duck.
4. Ducks in the same grade and semester combine to become a duck in the next grade and semester.
5. The higher the grade and semester duck, the higher the score.
6. The game ends when ducks pile up at a certain height or more.
7. You can access to the game link above and here. https://daxigua-master-seokjunkim.vercel.app/
8. Enjoy the game with friends comparing the scores.

**How can I make my own version?**
<br>
I will explain briefly by step, and refer to the link for detailed descriptions of the steps.

1. You should edit the image file you want to use to fit the resolution. (by PNG)
2. Download the Wesane game code file from GitHub. The GitHub link is in the refernce below.
3. Register the image for resolution and download the compressed file. A link to compress the file is in the rference below too.
4. Install Node.js
5. Sign up for Vercel via GitHub account.
6. You can use the cmd command prompt to deploy the Vercel app.
7. Then you can obtain a game link.
